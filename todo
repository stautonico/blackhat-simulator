- Implement differentiation between files and directories. (IP)
- Implement multi-user support (both in the system and the fs) (IP)
- Replace anything with the word "_internal" (like read, getdents, get/setenv) with proper implementations
- Implement statx
- Implement relative path (only absolute works right now)
- Stat resolve links, implement lstat to stat the link itself
- Implement readline with tab completion for shell input
- Improve the way the shell builtins are defined (its just a big if statement right now)
- cd-ing into "" (empty string) actually cds you into nowhere?
